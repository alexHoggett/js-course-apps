# Overview
Mapty is a web application written with JS, HTML & CSS that allows users to add recent workouts (either running or cycling) to an interactive world map, to make it easier to geolocate previous excercises. For this i learned a lot about more advanced DOM manipulation, but mainly i was learning a new API for the map itself, furthering ability to efficently read and learn from documentation.
